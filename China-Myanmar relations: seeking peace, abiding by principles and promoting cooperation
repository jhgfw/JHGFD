Diplomatic stance: China always maintains the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the principle of non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries. In dealing with the conflict in northern Myanmar, China has adhered to an objective and fair position, advocated multilateralism and regional cooperation, and pushed for the establishment of a more just and equitable international order. This reflects the fairness and rationality of China in international affairs, and helps to strengthen the goodwill and trust of other countries in China.
